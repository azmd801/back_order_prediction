# **Developing a Predictive Model for Backorder Management in Retail and Supply Chain Sectors**

---

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Background**

The retail and supply chain sectors are grappling with the widespread issue of backorders, a predicament that can adversely affect both inventory management and customer satisfaction. In light of this, a meticulous exploration of a substantial dataset has been undertaken, focusing on the pivotal role that predictive models can play in refining inventory management strategies and enhancing customer satisfaction. This exploration leverages the rich data available in ERP systems to construct a predictive model capable of forecasting backorders, thereby facilitating more streamlined planning at various operational levels.

### **1.2 Problem Statement**

*Backorders* are a pervasive issue in the retail and supply chain sectors, causing unexpected strains on production, logistics, and transportation. The analysis aims to construct a predictive model that can forecast backorders based on past data from inventories, supply chain, and sales, thereby aiding in streamlined planning and prevention of unforeseen operational strains. The goal is to classify products as going into backorder (Yes or No), utilizing the vast amount of data generated by ERP systems, which contains a wealth of historical data that can be harnessed for this purpose.

## **2. Methodology**

### **2.1 Data Analysis (From EDA Notebook)**

- The initial phase of the analysis involves a deep dive into the dataset, which showcases 23 variables and 1,687,861 observations.
- Despite a minor presence of missing cells (0.3%), the dataset presents significant challenges, including high skewness and a substantial number of zeros in certain columns, necessitating careful data preprocessing.
- As the analysis progresses, a detailed examination of the features reveals numerous outliers in numeric attributes, limiting insights from KDE plots and hinting at the need for robust techniques to manage these outliers. 

### **2.2 Data Transformation and Model Selection (From Data Transformation and Model Selection Notebook)**

- A systematic approach to data transformation is adopted, focusing on preprocessing choices as hyperparameters. 
- These choices are meticulously optimized through cross-validation to establish the best preprocessing pipeline. 
- The process commences with the removal of redundant features, such as 'sku'. 
- Various preprocessing techniques are explored, including handling outliers, addressing sparse features, and devising strategies for categorical feature handling and imputation. 
- Custom functions and classes are introduced to facilitate the data transformation process, with the CustomPipeline class emerging as a central component that enhances flexibility and efficiency in creating diverse machine learning pipelines.

## **3. Results**

### **3.1 Evaluation Metrics**

- The chosen model undergoes rigorous evaluation to ascertain its effectiveness and pinpoint areas for improvement. 
- Achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.84 and a ROC AUC score of 0.93, the model excels in identifying most backorders. 
- There is room for optimization, particularly in reducing false positives, as indicated by the test precision score (0.09) and the test F1 score (0.16).

### **3.2 Discussion**

The overarching goal of this project is to foster proactive management strategies and enhance operational efficiency in the retail and supply chain sectors. This is achieved by fine-tuning the model for high balanced accuracy, which subsequently leads to improved resource allocation and increased customer satisfaction.
